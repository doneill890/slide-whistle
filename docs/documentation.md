# Schematics
<!-- Include images of the schematics for your system. They should follow best practices for schematic drawings with all parts and pins clearly labeled. You may draw your schematics either with a software tool or neatly by hand. -->

# Source Code Overview

The source code for the project is located in the Github repository [here](https://github.com/doneill890/slide-whistle/tree/main/src). 

The MCU files there can be uploaded to the STM32L432KC microcontroller on the Nucleo development board. They are used to generate the correct signals for the fan power control, motor controller IC, and SPI transactions to the FPGA. The FPGA files were uploaded to the ICE40UP5K FPGA on the UPduino v3.1 development board. These describe hardware that takes in SPI messages from the MCU and interfaces with the LCD to print the desired text.
