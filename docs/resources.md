# References

Do we have any references? Maybe some datasheets?

# Inspiration

The idea for this project came from a similar project Kip found [here]([https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089Y3QPYF/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A235LT0EDLFSAR&psc=1](https://mitxela.com/projects/slide)).

This reference project has the same main goal, to automatically play a song on a slide whistle, using an ATmega chip to drive two servos that move the slide whistle through a linkage system.
