# Autonomous Slide Whistle Portfolio
This repo contains a summary of the design of a slide whistle and LCD screen that could be controlled in parallel with an MCU and an FPGA. The design and results of the Project are documented here, along with the necessary source files.

The website presenting this information nicely can be accessed at [https://doneill890.github.io/slide-whistle/](https://doneill890.github.io/slide-whistle/)
